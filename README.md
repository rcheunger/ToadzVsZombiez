ToadzVsZombiez is an addictive, side scroller, play-to-earn game that has integrated a fully functional in-game ERC-20 token ($TOAD) deployed on the Polygon Mumbai testnet. Players must traverse through the Toadverse to collect $TOAD while shooting zombies and avoiding pits of death. There is also an in-game ERC-721 standard NFT collection of 4,444 unique Toadz that can be minted by spending the in game currency. 

All artwork including the entire NFT collection was designed originally by me.
